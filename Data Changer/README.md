**The given script used for A/B testing based on a URL parameter or a cookie value to change displayed elements (such as phone numbers) on a website. Here's an outline of the script and its functions:**

1. **Utility Functions**:
    - **empty**: Clears child nodes of an element.
    - **createCookie**: Creates a new cookie with a specified name, value, and expiration in days.
    - **readCookie**: Reads the value of a cookie given its name.
    - **checkCookie**: Checks if a cookie exists.
    - **eraseCookie**: Deletes a cookie by setting its expiration date to the past.
  
2. **A/B Testing Functions**:
    - **getCampValueFromURL**: Checks the current URL for specific "camp=" parameters and returns an associated value.
    - **createABtest**: Determines which version of the A/B test to show to the user based on the URL or existing cookie value.
    - **sendDimension**: Pushes data related to A/B testing into the `dataLayer` for Google Tag Manager.
    
3. **Phone Number Change**:
    - **changePhoneNumber**: A higher-order function that returns a function. This returned function is used to change the displayed phone numbers on the website based on certain class names.

4. **Configuration Variables**:
    - **prefix**: A prefix used for cookie names related to the A/B test.
    - **phones**: An array of phone numbers.
    - **changes**: An object defining how phone numbers should change based on A/B test results.
    - **variants**: An array that dynamically builds variants of A/B tests based on the `changes` object.

5. **Execution Logic**:
    - If a relevant cookie exists, the script checks its value to determine which phone number to display.
    - If no cookie exists but the URL contains a "camp=" parameter, the script decides which A/B test variant to use.

**TO DO:**:

1. **Modularization**: It would be beneficial to structure this script in a more modular way, perhaps utilizing ES6 modules, if supported, or splitting the code into self-contained functions or classes.

2. **Use Event Listeners**: If the script relies on certain elements to be present on the page, it might be helpful to ensure the script runs after the DOM has fully loaded, either by placing the script at the bottom of the `<body>` or using an event listener for the DOMContentLoaded event.

3. **Error Handling**: There's an assumption that certain values (like the cookie's) will always be in a specific format (e.g., "x.y"). This could lead to potential issues if unexpected values are encountered. It would be good to add error handling for scenarios that might break the script.

4. **Optimize Cookie Parsing**: Multiple functions parse cookies in slightly different ways (`readCookie`, `checkCookie`). This could be streamlined into a single function or class that handles all cookie-related operations.
